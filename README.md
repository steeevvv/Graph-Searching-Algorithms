# Graph-Searching-Algorithms
A group project for the course CSE 472 - Artificial Intelligence. Spring 2020 Semester.

--- 

The goal of this project is to implement a Graph, and graph searching algorithms (Informed and Uninformed) in python. 

Some searching algorithms are implemented like: 
* DFS
* BFS
* UCS
* Greedy
* A*

A GUI is also implemented to show the process of (inserting/deleting) (vertices/nodes) each at a time. Also, it shows at the end the expanded nodes and the path to reach the goal node(s).
